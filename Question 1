Summarize your experience with khan academy.


BrainStorm: 
- Fun & Easy
- Challenging at times.
- Helped me learn.



My experience I had with Khan Academy was in a sense bumpy, When I first started on Khan Academy I was a little doubtful that I would
really learn anything significant, After a couple months in I found myself actually learning and understanding what im doing. In HTML 
and Intro to Javascript I loved the way they explain and showed guided me step by step to solving problems without actually giving the 
entire solution away. I especially found the videos very helpful since they showed live examples and demonstrations on how to solve a
certain problem.

One problem I had with Khan Academy was that once it got to Natural simulations everything went from Simplistic and easy to a bit of a challenge,
As a student who hadnt taken physics, I was not able to understand some of the concepts that they were trying to explain to us. The lessons were 
mostly text based and required alot of reading and due to my style of learning I often lost track and/or interest in what I was doing.
Overall I enjoyed my experience on Khan Academy.
