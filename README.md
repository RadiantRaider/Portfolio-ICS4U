<h1>Portfolio ~ ICS4U</h1>

The best of my progress and work done throughout the semester will be recorded here:

<br>
1. Free Code Camp Projects & Modules:

 Using Free Code Camp was helpful it went in-depth into its lessons and explained things a little more then Khan Academy usually does, there are no videos or anything but the simplicity will allow you to burn through the challenges but also understand what your doing at the same time. One thing I found a little annoying about it was that a tiny mistake such as a spelling error or an punctuational error the code will fail and not work so I had to go and read through all of my code to find the mistakes just to fin out that I accidently put a space in the wrong place.

2. Intro to JS
    
 I will continue to use Khan Academy's Java Script tutorial because was fun and it showed me that coding uses lots of creativity and there is so many things you can do with it. The lessons were simple and the videos were extremley helpful, they guided me through if I need help and I understood what I was doing most importantly.

3. Natural Simulations
    
   I will go back to Natural simulation on Khan academy once I get a grasp on a bit of physics since the course has some physics
concepts that had me confused sometimes and took me a while to actualy get though it has taught me how much math and different concepts that are used in Natural simulations and I will for sure re-do the course when I have the chance.

4. MicroBit

5. SQL
    I will continue to use Khan Academy's SQL tutorial as it shows me the foundations of creating programs that

6. Cubes
    A will DEFINETLEY continue cubing it has given me a short but sweet introduction to algorithms.
