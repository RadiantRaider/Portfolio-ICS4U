How will you continue learning about computer science?

Brainstorm:
- Sharpen my skills through Khan Academy & Free Code Camp
- Join communities
- challenge myself.


Over the summer I plan to continue learning more computer science concepts, languages, techniques etc. I think I have a good grasp of 
JavaScript and HTML however I do think my skills can be improved on as well as my problem solving skills,If I want to go into a computer 
science based career my skills would have to be way better then they are at the moment. Joining communities, reaching out to other 
programmers will help me learn more about computer science since I can compare,contrast, adapt new skills, get support and even
do some projects with other people, its generally a good way to learn. Another way I will try to continue to learn is  by challenging myself
and pushing my limits to see what I need to work on and what im strong in.
